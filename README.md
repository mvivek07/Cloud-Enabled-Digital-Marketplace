🌱 Project Overview

A large amount of fresh farm produce is discarded every year due to failing cosmetic standards set by supermarkets. Farmers suffer financial losses, while many local businesses such as juice bars, caterers, restaurants, and community kitchens need affordable produce where appearance does not matter.
This project addresses this issue by building a digital platform (web & mobile) to connect farmers with local businesses to buy and sell surplus or cosmetically imperfect produce directly.

🚀 Objectives

Reduce food waste by creating a structured channel for imperfect but fresh produce.

Improve the income of farmers by offering a direct-selling platform.

Provide local businesses and NGOs with affordable fresh produce.

Promote sustainability and strengthen the local food ecosystem.

👥 Target Users

Farmers: There is often surplus or cosmetically imperfect produce available for sale.

Local Businesses: Juice bars, caterers, restaurants, and small retailers wanting low-cost ingredients.

Community Kitchens / NGOs: Seeking budget-friendly fresh produce.
